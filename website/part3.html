          <h3>Findings</h3>
          <p>
            Through analysis of the data analytics, it has been established that there is an overall downtrend in the number of market listings across all sectors, while the average salary remains relatively stable. The large majority of salaries are listed at between $20-80. With quite a few outliers all listed at $200-999 which most likely correspond to the maximum possible values possible on SEEK. 
          </p>
          <p>
            There was a dip in salaries in mid-November most likely corresponding to a listing of casual Christmas positions in retail. In early December there was a surge in salaries most likely related to people leaving high paying positions to spend time with family instead. For people searching for a high paying job, this corresponds to the best time to apply.
          </p>
          <p>
            Based off the number of listings in each sector, and the average salary in each, ICT appears to be the best field for balancing a high demand with a good salary (highest demand and 2nd highest average salary). While CEO & General Management offer the highest salary, it is not advisable to enter this sector looking for a job due to the low availability. 
          </p>

          <h3>Balancing the Markets</h3>
          <p>
            For balancing the job market, it is suggested that more workers choose to go into sectors such as ICT, Trades. Healthcare and Hospitality. This will help lower the number of active listings on SEEK for these industries. 
          </p>
          <p>
            When balancing the locations in terms of employment, it is suggested that employers move more towards remote working to prevent the oversaturation of jobs which are exclusive in cities. 
          </p>

          <h3>Refinements</h3>
          <p>
            The main refinement which could be made to the dataset is a longer timeframe than a few months. If for instance, the timeframe was expanded to a few years; seasonality could be taken into account to allow for looking at long term trends. Without any big disruptions, the job market tends to remain stable over the timeframe of months and hence, very little can be extracted from the data by looking at trends over time.
          </p>
          <p>
            In addition to this, the 2019 data is missing multiple fields including the sector and subsector of each job. This makes time series analysis for the data broken down into sectors even harder as there is only 3 months to look at. 
          </p>
          <p>
            Other job listing websites should be explored and if international websites are used, the international data could be compared to Australian data to compare the markets in different countries. Perhaps this could even be used to make predictions about where to move depending on the decided sector as a career path.
          </p>

          <h3>Implications for Employees and Employers</h3>
          <p>
            The main implication for employees within the findings of the data analysis is that to land a casual retail job, it is best to look around mid-November and to find a high paying job it is best to look around early/mid-December. As for which sector to target, for the best job opportunities it is recommended to live in a major city and choose to do ICT. This will also provide a competitive salary. For a high salary with out the skill investment needed for ICT, it is possible to chose to do mining work in a small country town such as Port Headland.
